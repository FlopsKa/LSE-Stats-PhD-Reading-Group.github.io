# Some suggestions on giving a talk

Your talk should be around 60 minutes long, with some time left over questions. The only restriction on the topic is that it should be in some way related to your research. For example you could present potential strategies for a tricky proof, software libraries you have built during your research, or a piece of interesting data analysis. 

Don't feel you have to present "polished" results, the whole point of the reading group is to talk about interesting open questions and ongoing work! If you are looking for some inspiration, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE8NIszVkKE) for a good example of a technical talk on whiteboard, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l812pUnKxME) for a talk with some interactive live coding.

See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_-owjKIbA&t=364s) for a talk on how to give a talk. Also, here are some dos and don'ts more specific to our reading group:

✨ Make your talk interactive

✨ Use whiteboard as much as possible to  

✨ Feel free to present "incomplete" results or even just interesting proof strategies


❌ Try not to use slides, unless you are presenting plots or tables

❌ Don't assume too much of your audience (throughout your talk you will be the most knowledgeable person in the room)

❌ Don't spend too much time on small technical details
