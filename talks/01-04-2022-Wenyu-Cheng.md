# Robust mean estimation (and beyond)

We will start with mean estimation and review some of the developments in the history of robust statistics. Then we focus on generalized Catoni loss function with requirement of barely over one moment. Finally, we show its application to higher moments, in covariance and kurtosis estimation.
