# Implementing Sequential Parameter Estimation

We discuss the interaction between a Model, data generated by this model, and an Algorithm to estimate Model parameter given the data. In particular:
* How do you implement your custom algorithms?
* What is a Model - a measure? a function? a container holding parameter?
* How would you execute your code/algorithms in a real world setting?
* Does this change in a sequential context, i.e., new data is observed over time.
* How can you make parameter estimation in a sequential context computationally performant?

*If time permits:*
  * *Connect discussion to Probabilistic Programming (PPL) (code demo)*
