# Local Times of Brownian Motion

We provide a short introduction to occupation and local times of a Brownian motion. We briefly discuss the
concept of elastic Brownian motion as a tool for computing distributions involving Brownian local time at 
one or several points. We then derive the distributional properties of the Brownian local time at an inverse
local time.
