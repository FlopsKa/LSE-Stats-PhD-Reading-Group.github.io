# Integer-Value Time Series 

During the presentation, we will discuss the classical integer-valued autoregressive model, called INAR(1), as well as its variation. 
Then we will extend it to two-dimensional case, discussing its possible applications and a statistical inference method: 
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
